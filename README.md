# Togglr

[![CI](https://github.com/togglr-project/togglr/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/togglr-project/togglr/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Togglr is a **feature flag and experimentation platform** for developers and product teams.

It allows you to **toggle features on/off**, run **A/B and multi-variant experiments**, and gradually roll out features based on user segments, time, or adaptive learning algorithms.

---

## üöÄ Experimentation and Algorithms

Togglr extends classic feature flags into a **full experimentation framework**.

Each feature can have multiple **variants** (A/B/N arms), and you can attach an **algorithm** that dynamically controls which variant is shown to users ‚Äî optimizing for reward or conversion automatically.

### Supported algorithms

Currently implemented:

- **Œµ-Greedy** ‚Äî explores randomly with probability *Œµ*, otherwise exploits the best variant.
- **Thompson Sampling** ‚Äî Bayesian approach balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** ‚Äî selects the variant with the highest confidence bound for expected reward.

Each algorithm can be configured per environment (e.g., `production`, `staging`) with custom numeric settings (for example):

```json
{
  "epsilon": 0.1
}
````

### Architecture of Experiments

* Each **feature** has one active algorithm per **environment**.
* Each algorithm tracks statistics (evaluations, successes, failures, rewards) per variant.
* Feedback events (from SDKs or API) are aggregated in TimescaleDB.
* The **BanditManager** keeps live statistics in memory and periodically syncs them to TimescaleDB.
* Algorithms learn over time and adjust rollout dynamically ‚Äî no manual tweaking required.

> ‚ÄúOne algorithm ‚Äî one brain per feature.
> Variants are its hands.
> Feedback is its experience.‚Äù

## Architecture

* **Backend** ‚Äî Go (TimescaleDB, NATS JetStream, REST API, WebSocket broadcaster)
* **Frontend** ‚Äî React + TypeScript
